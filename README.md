# Paint Tool (C++ / OpenGL with FreeGLUT)

## Description
An interactive drawing application developed in C++ using OpenGL and FreeGLUT at UC Merced. Supports multiple shapes, freehand drawing, resizing, color editing, movement, layering, and GUI-based controls. Designed with object-oriented principles and interactive event handling.

## Features
- **Drawing Tools:** Pencil (freehand), Eraser, Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Polygon  
- **Shape Manipulation:** Move, resize, change color, bring to front, send to back  
- **Layering & Selection:** Select individual shapes or scribbles to modify  
- **User Interface:** Toolbar and canvas for intuitive interaction  
- **Memory Management:** Dynamic allocation and cleanup to prevent leaks  

## Implementation Highlights
- **Language & Libraries:** C++ with OpenGL and FreeGLUT  
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Custom Shape classes to represent drawable elements  
- **Event Handling:** Mouse and toolbar events control drawing, selection, and editing  
- **GUI Logic:** Real-time updates for visual feedback when interacting with shapes  

## User Interaction
1. Select a tool from the toolbar  
2. Draw shapes or scribbles on the canvas  
3. Modify shapes using the toolbar options (resize, recolor, move, layer management)  
4. Undo or clear actions as needed  

## About
Interactive C++ drawing application leveraging OpenGL for rendering and user interaction. Developed collaboratively with four contributors at UC Merced as a course project, emphasizing object-oriented design, memory management, event handling, and GUI programming.
