DONE    10 points: paint brush tool (draw points as a scribble while mouse is down)     
DONE    5 points: eraser tool (delete shape/scribble), but it is recommended to revisit this feature as we might need to do it by actually deleting the shape or scribble rather than just painting white over the object.                              
DONE    5 points: clear screen tool (delete all shapes/scribbles)
        10 points: RGB color picker

        10 points: ability to resize selected shape

DONE    10 points: ability to move selected shape/scribble by dragging
        10 points: ability to bring selected shape/scribble to the front
