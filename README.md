Paint Tool (C++ / OpenGL with FreeGLUT)
Developed an interactive drawing program with support for shapes, scribbles, resizing, color editing, movement, and layering.
Implemented object-oriented design with custom Shape classes and rendering using OpenGL.
Practiced memory management, event handling, and graphical user interface logic in C++.

Project Progess Timeline:
DONE    10 points: paint brush tool (draw points as a scribble while mouse is down)     
DONE    5 points: eraser tool (delete shape/scribble), but it is recommended to revisit this feature as we might need to do it by actually deleting the shape or scribble rather than just painting white over the object.                              
DONE    5 points: clear screen tool (delete all shapes/scribbles)
DONE    10 points: RGB color picker
DONE    10 points: 4 shape tools
DONE    10 points: selector tool ability to select a shape/scribble by clicking on it
DONE    10 points: ability to resize selected shape
DONE    10 points: ability to change color of selected shape/scribble
DONE    10 points: ability to move selected shape/scribble by dragging
DONE    10 points: ability to bring selected shape/scribble to the front
DONE    10 points: ability to send selected shape/scribble to the back

Finished with requirements, maybe polish on some visual changes.
